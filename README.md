# Vaccination-tweet-sentiment-analysis
Our goal is to analyze the sentiments of the recent tweets and how people feel about vaccination.
Display some data visualizations and data summary.
Then we will use Naive Bayes/Regression Tree and Logistic Regression to build a model to predict the sentiment of a text.
Finally we will use Lime and Eli5 to explain some sample tweets.
